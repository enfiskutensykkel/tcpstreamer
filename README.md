streamer
========

An utility program to set up TCP streams with the characteristics similar to 
those of streams created by real-time and interactive applications,
and to see how these streams behave in competition with both each other and
with so-called "greedy" streams. 

Please note that before trying to understand what this utility is for, 
you should have a fairly good understanding of how TCP works:
how it divides data into segments, how acknowledgements work and especially
how it handles retransmissions and the retransmission time-out calculation, 
and when and how exponential back-off applies.
You should also have an in-depth knowledge about the congestion avoidance mechanisms (i.e. Fast 
Retransmit and Fast Recovery). 

The purpose of this utility program is to test how the various congestion
avoidance techniques (and other reliability mechanisms for that matter) in TCP 
affects streams with the characteristics of traffic generated by interactive
applications, such as MMOGs or VoIP. These traffic patterns are very different
from traffic created by more "traditional" TCP applications, so-called "greedy"
streams, e.g. HTTP and FTP, which TCP congestion avoidance originally was
designed for.

Usage
-----

You can either start this program as a receiver instance, in which case it will
accept incoming TCP connections and act as a traffic sink, or you can start 
this program as a streamer instance, loading one of the available streamer
implementations.

To start a receiver instance, simply invoke the program with:

		./streamer

To start a streamer instance, invoke the program with:

		./streamer -s implementation hostname

Where implementation is the name of an available streamer implementation, and 
hostname is either the hostname or IPv4 address of the host running a receiver
instance. The default port is 50000, if you want to change the port the program
listens to / streams to, use the -p option.

		./streamer -p 1234

		./streamer -p 1234 -s implementation hostname

Depending on the streamer implementation, you might need to pass arguments to
the streamer program. To see a list of available streamer implementations and
arguments they require, see

		./streamer --help [implementation]



Compilitation and building the project
--------------------------------------

From a source code point of view, any C99 compliant C compiler will do for
compiling and building the project. However, I have a quite intricate build 
script (Makefile) to make some auto-generated code for me due to the program
design (see the 'Program design' section). So unless you replicate the building
in some other fashion, I recommend that you use:
* Make (build-essentials)
* GCC
* sh or bash

If you're running a Linux distro, this shouldn't be a problem. Simply type
		make all
into the terminal in the root project directory.

If you're using Windows, you might want to look into [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/install.html).
